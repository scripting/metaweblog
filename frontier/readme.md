# Frontier glue for metawelob API

this code is from opml.root and was used to form the interface to WordPress from Frontier apps.

system.verbs.apps.metaweblog -- client code

system.verbs.apps.wordpress -- client code

For easy reading, I am posting it to the repo as if it were JavaScript code.

Lets see how that works! ;-)
